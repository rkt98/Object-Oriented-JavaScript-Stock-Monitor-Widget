### Preview of Assignment
Preview of how the widget looks when loaded onto a sample webpage. The data does not come from an external source and is just test data stored in a local database the sql to creat the database is availiable in a .txt file in the SQL folder in this repo. General example of how widgets can work. Some more styling and adding an external updating sorce of stock information would be a good way to explore widgets also adding an option to remove a selected stock from the list so it doesnt get too long and an option to search for stocks instead of being limited to the 6 companies in the test data.
